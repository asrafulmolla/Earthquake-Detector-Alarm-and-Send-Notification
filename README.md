# Earthquake Detector Alarm and Send Notification

## Description
This project creates a simple Earthquake Detection System using Arduino. The system detects seismic activity, triggers an alarm, and sends notifications to alert users.

## Features
- **Real-time Earthquake Detection**: Detects seismic activity with a sensor.
- **Alarm Trigger**: Activates an alarm when an earthquake is detected.
- **Instant Notifications**: Sends alerts via email or SMS.

## Prerequisites
- Arduino IDE
- Compatible Earthquake detection sensor (e.g., an accelerometer or a seismic sensor)

## Usage
1. **Setup the Sensor**: Connect the seismic sensor to the Arduino as per the projectâ€™s wiring instructions.
   
2. **Upload the Code**: Open the provided Arduino code in the Arduino IDE and upload it to the Arduino board.

3. The system will now continuously monitor seismic activity. Once an earthquake is detected, the alarm will sound, and notifications will be sent to the configured recipients.
